# The Dungeon Mod

### How to download:
Press the green "Code" button and hit "Download zip". This will give you the mod alongside a readme. Drag the mod into your mod folder and launch Forge 1.8.9: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9

### What it does:
This mod adds Secret Waypoints to Skyblock Dungeons, allowing for faster and easier secret finding. The hotkey to configure waypoints is "P" by default.

Alternatively, you can also view images of the secret locations with the SkyblockPersonalized Mod by pressing the hotkey "O" while in a room.

### Why is this useful?
For those who haven't memorized secrets, trying to find secrets takes forever, especially when you have to spend a ton of time searching through channels for the right room. This mod makes it easy as you can immediately see where a secret is.

### Is this bannable?
Short answer: This mod follows the general interpretation of Hypixel's rules, does not modify packets in any way, and is by all means completely safe to use.

### Hotkeys:
(Configurable in Controls Menu)
 - P - Opens Secret Waypoints configuration GUI
 - O - Opens images of secret locations
 
### Commands:
 - /room - Tells you in chat what room you are standing in.
 - /room help - Displays this message in chat.
 - /room waypoints - Opens Secret Waypoints config GUI, alternatively can be opened with hotkey
 - /room move \<x\> \<y\> - Moves the GUI room name text to a coordinate. <x> and <y> are numbers between 0 and 100. (Default is 50 for \<x\> and 5 for \<y\>)
